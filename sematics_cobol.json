  "clauses": {
    "PIC_A": "A character position that can contain only a letter of the Latin alphabet or a space. Each 'A' is counted as one character position in the size of the data item.",
    "PIC_B": "For usage DISPLAY, a character position into which an alphanumeric space is inserted. Each 'B' is counted as one character position in the size of the data item.",
    "PIC_E": "Marks the start of the exponent in an external floating-point item. Each 'E' is counted as one character position in the size of the data item.",
    "PIC_G": "A DBCS character position. Each 'G' is counted as one character position in the size of the data item.",
    "PIC_N": "For category national, a national character position when specified with usage NATIONAL or when usage is unspecified and the NSYMBOL(NATIONAL) compiler option is in effect. Each 'N' is counted as one character position in the size of the data item.",
    "PIC_P": "An assumed decimal scaling position. Used to specify the location of an assumed decimal point when the point is not within the number that appears in the data item. Not counted in the size of the data item. Scaling position characters are counted in determining the maximum number of digit positions.",
    "PIC_S": "An indicator of the presence (but not the representation, and not necessarily the position) of an operational sign. Not counted in the size of the elementary item, unless an associated SIGN clause specifies the SEPARATE CHARACTER phrase.",
    "PIC_V": "An indicator of the location of the assumed decimal point. Does not represent a character position. Not counted in the size of the elementary item.",
    "PIC_X": "A character position that can contain any allowable character from the alphanumeric character set of the computer. Each 'X' is counted as one character position in the size of the data item.",
    "PIC_Z": "A leading numeric character position. When that position contains a zero, a space character replaces the zero. Each 'Z' is counted as one character position in the size of the data item.",
    "PIC_9": "A character position that contains a numeral. Each nine specifies one decimal digit in the value of the item. For usages DISPLAY and NATIONAL, each nine is counted as one character position in the size of the data item.",
    "PIC_0": "A character position into which the numeral zero is inserted. Each zero is counted as one character position in the size of the data item.",
    "PIC_SLASH": "A character position into which the slash character is inserted. Each slash character is counted as one character position in the size of the data item.",
    "PIC_COMMA": "A character position into which a comma is inserted. Each comma is counted as one character position in the size of the data item.",
    "PIC_PERIOD": "An editing symbol that represents the decimal point for alignment purposes. In addition, it represents a character position into which a period is inserted. Each period is counted as one character position in the size of the data item.",
    "PIC_SIGN_CONTROL": "Editing sign control symbols. Each represents the character position into which the editing sign control symbol is placed. Each character used in the editing sign symbol is counted as one character position in the size of the data item.",
    "PIC_ASTERISK": "A check protect symbol: a leading numeric character position into which an asterisk is placed when that position contains a zero. Each asterisk is counted as one character position in the size of the item.",
    "PIC_CURRENCY": "A currency symbol represents a character position into which a currency sign value is placed. The first occurrence of a currency symbol adds the number of characters in the currency sign value to the size of the data item. Each subsequent occurrence adds one character position to the size of the data item.",
    "USAGE_BINARY": "Specified for binary data items. Negative numbers are represented as the two's complement of the positive number with the same absolute value. The amount of storage occupied by a binary item depends on the number of decimal digits defined in its PICTURE clause: 1 through 4 digits occupy 2 bytes (halfword), 5 through 9 digits occupy 4 bytes (fullword), 10 through 18 digits occupy 8 bytes (doubleword). Binary data is big-endian: the operational sign is contained in the leftmost bit.",
    "USAGE_COMP": "This is the equivalent of BINARY. The COMPUTATIONAL phrase is synonymous with BINARY.",
    "USAGE_COMP-1": "Specified for internal floating-point items (single precision). COMP-1 items are 4 bytes long.",
    "USAGE_COMP-2": "Specified for internal floating-point items (double precision). COMP-2 items are 8 bytes long.",
    "USAGE_PACKED-DECIMAL": "Specified for internal decimal items. Such an item appears in storage in packed decimal format. There are two digits for each character position, except for the trailing character position, which is occupied by the low-order digit and the sign.",
    "USAGE_COMP-3": "This is the equivalent of PACKED-DECIMAL.",
    "USAGE_COMP-4": "This is the equivalent of BINARY.",
    "USAGE_COMP-5": "These data items are represented in storage as binary data. The data items can contain values up to the capacity of the native binary representation (2, 4, or 8 bytes), rather than being limited to the value implied by the number of nines in the picture. When numeric data is moved or stored into a COMP-5 item, truncation occurs at the binary field size rather than at the COBOL picture size limit.",
    "USAGE_DISPLAY": "The data item is stored in character form, one character for each 8-bit byte. External decimal items with USAGE DISPLAY are sometimes referred to as zoned decimal items. Each digit of a number is represented by a single byte. The 4 high-order bits of each byte are zone bits; the 4 high-order bits of the low-order byte represent the sign of the item. The 4 low-order bits of each byte contain the value of the digit.",
    "USAGE_DISPLAY-1": "The DISPLAY-1 phrase defines an item as DBCS. The data item is stored in character form, with each character occupying 2 bytes of storage.",
    "USAGE_FUNCTION-POINTER": "The FUNCTION-POINTER phrase defines an item as a function-pointer data item. A function-pointer data item can contain the address of a descriptor for a procedure entry point. A function-pointer is a 4-byte elementary item or an 8-byte elementary item depending on whether the LP(32) or LP(64) is in effect.",
    "REDEFINES": "The REDEFINES clause allows you to use different data description entries to describe the same computer storage area. When an area is redefined, all descriptions of the area are always in effect; that is, redefinition does not supersede a previous description. The usage of a redefining data item need not be the same as that of a redefined item. This does not, however, cause any change in the format or content of existing data."

  "statements": {
    "MoveStatement": 
    { "general": "Any necessary conversion of data from one form of internal representation to another takes place during the move, along with any specified editing in, or de-editing implied by, the receiving item.",
      "to_alphabetic": "Alignment and any necessary space filling or truncation occur. If the size of the sending item is greater than the size of the receiving item, excess characters on the right are truncated after the receiving item is filled.",
      "to_alphanumeric": "Alignment and any necessary space filling or truncation take place. If the size of the sending item is greater than the size of the receiving item, excess characters on the right are truncated after the receiving item is filled. If the initial sending item has an operational sign, the unsigned value is used.",
      "to_numeric": "Alignment by decimal point and any necessary zero filling take place. If the receiving item is signed, the sign of the sending item is placed in the receiving item, with any necessary sign conversion. If the sending item is unsigned, a positive operational sign is generated. If the receiving item is unsigned, no operational sign is generated and the absolute value is used. When the sending item is numeric-edited, the compiler de-edits the sending data to establish its unedited numeric value, which is then used in the move."
    }, 
    "ComputeStatement": "The COMPUTE statement assigns the value of an arithmetic expression to one or more data items. When the COMPUTE statement is executed, the value of arithmetic expression is calculated and stored as the new value of each data item referenced by identifier-1. The ROUNDED phrase can be used. The ON SIZE ERROR phrase can be used."
